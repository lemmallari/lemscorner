### I'm a Pinoy based in Singapore doing SharePoint development. I primarily work on the microsoft platform (Office 365, Azure, etc) but I also dabble with other technology stack from time to time.

I'm currently working in DBS as a SharePoint Developer helping my team create rich and interactive SharePoint sites for the company. Besides SharePoint development, I also help others optimize their work using Power Automate.

I've been doing SharePoint for almost the *entirety* of my career. I've led small to large SharePoint projects for different enterprises and government agencies. It's not just all about SharePoint and Microsoft for me though. Recently I started ramping up my Agile skills and got certified as a Scrum Master (I see this as an alternate career in the event that I give up on development).

Outside of work, I mainly spend most of my time on:
* Learning more about Cryptocurrencies
* Reading up on new stuff that can make my work easier
* Watching Dota streams in twitch
* Playing games (mostly mobile) with friends

If you've got questions on O365 or Crypto, want to play games or just want to say hi, you can add me up in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mallaril/) or [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dota2srael/). You can also follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/lemscorner) though I haven't tweeted since 2018!
