The cryptocurrency total market cap crashed to around 1.35 Trillion US Dollars last Wednesday erasing most of the gains it accumulated the past few months. I'm not 100% sure if we're out of the woods yet, but the past few hours today showed a bit of promise.

If this is the first time you experienced a market crash like this and you're still here good job and congratulations. If you're a market-tested crypto holder or trader from way back, then this should just be a normal day for you.

Regardless of the market status, it is always good to increase your holdings. In this post, I'll be discussing 6 ways to earn more crypto and increase your holdings.

### 1. Staking

{% image "staking.jpeg" "staking" %}

Let's face it, trading is not for everyone. Sure you'll see some people post their insane gains once in a while but I'm 100% sure that they can't do that every single time. Non-traders usually just buy some coins and hold it for a long time waiting for the best time to sell. If you're holding the coin for a long time anyway, it's better to stake it so that you earn more from it.

Staking allows users to store their coins in their wallets and passively earn more coins. One example is Cardano (ADA) where you can [easily stake your coins using your mobile](/yoroi-ada-staking) to earn more ADA. Some exchanges like Binance offers both flexible and locked staking providing users multiple options in staking their coins. DeFi staking is also a great way to earn more coins as they give out higher interest compared to the previous two I mentioned but with higher risks involved.

**PROS:** You earn cryptocurrency passively by just holding the coin. Better interest than banks and other traditional financial instruments in the market.
**CONS:** Yield is dependent on the amount you stake. The more coins you stake the higher yield you get. If you're staking in exchanges there is always a risk of them being hacked. For DeFi staking, there is a risk for their smart contracts being exploited.

### 2. DeFi Yield Farming or Liquidity Mining

{% image "cakeuni.jpg" "cake vs uni" %}

DeFi or Decentralized Finance has been making big waves this cycle. The idea is to have multiple financial products be available using the decentralized blockchain network removing the middleman like banks and other financial institutions in the process.

Some of the prominent DeFi right now are Uniswap which is running on top of the Ethereum network and Pancakeswap which runs on the Binance Smart Chain. There are other DeFi's in the market but these two hold the most volume as of this writing. So how do you earn more crypto using DeFi?

DeFi's have decentralized exchanges as one of their main features. Here instead of the order book dictating the price of the coin to be sold or bought, it uses an Automated Market Maker which relies on a mathematical formula to determine the price of the coin. For decentralized exchanges to work, users need to provide liquidity to the exchange. When providing liquidity, users lock their funds in the pool which is then used for the exchange. When you provide liquidity, you get LP tokens which you can use later on to reclaim the fund you provided to the pool together with your share of fees that you gained.

What's great with PancakeSwap is once you get your LP Token, you can also stake in what they call Farms and earn their native coin CAKE. It doesn't end there though. Once you get your CAKE, you can also stake it in other pools to earn other coins. Just by providing liquidity, you're generating more and more coins.

To sum it all up using PancakeSwap's context, you provide liquidity to get an LP Token, you stake that LP Token to earn CAKE and you stake that CAKE to earn more coins. Yield farming provides crazy APY ranging from 20% to 1000%.

**PROS:** Higher returns compared to simply staking your coin. Staking one type of coin (eg. CAKE) can help you gain other coins.
**CONS:** Yield is dependent on the liquidity you provide. There is a possibility of the smart contract used to be exploited. Providing liquidity incurs an impermanent loss.

### 3. Playing Games

If you love crypto and you love playing games then this approach might be good for you. As NFTs are gaining traction, some games being developed in the different cryptocurrency networks are now starting to promote the play to earn model. Imagine playing games and at the same time earning crypto!

One of the popular games right now is called Lost Relics. It's an action RPG hack and slash dungeon crawler. Compared to your usual RPG which has used the class systems like the classic Final Fantasy games, Lost Relics revolve around your pieces of equipment which gives you different bonuses as well as different abilities. These in-game assets are all NFTs which you can also sell in the market to net you more crypto.

Another popular game right now is called Axie Infinity. It's similar to pokemon however instead of catching monsters you breed them. They start as an egg and later when they hatch you can use them in adventures and even battle it out with other Axie owners. The game even had a [documentary released recently](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/people-in-philippines-earn-cryptocurrency-playing-nft-video-game-axie-infinity.html#:~:text=Axie%20Infinity%20allows%20players%20to,people%20who%20play%20the%20game) which shows a group of folks in the Philippines playing the game to earn crypto.

These games are quite limited as of now but as this category in crypto gains more traction we should expect more games to offer this type of model.

**PROS:** You earn cryptocurrency while playing the games!
**CONS:** Games like Axie Infinity require a bit of investment to fully take advantage of the play to earn model. A rough estimate based on the current prices places roughly a 6 month ROI given a modest investment made to the game.

### 4. Mining

Cryptocurrency mining will always be a good way to increase your cryptocurrency holdings. Compared to staking, mining requires additional hardware and above-average technical knowledge before you can start earning additional coins. Mining is also good as it helps make the network much more secure and decentralized. Bitcoin and Ethereum are still the top coins to mine as of this writing. However, there are still other coins like Siacoin, Ravencoin, Firo, and much more which you can mine and accumulate.

**PROS:** You earn cryptocurrency passively by just leaving your mining rig running 24x7.
**CONS:** Requires significant investment and technical knowledge to be profitable. ROI is dependent on the value of the coin being mined.

### 5. Airdrops

{% image "airdrops.png" "airdrop" %}

There's a saying that there's no such thing as free money. However, in cryptocurrencies, there are rare times where get free money through airdrops! It's not as common as it used to be before, but there are still some coins that offer airdrops. Way back in 2017 and 2018 during the ICO craze, project teams offer free coins to users by simply joining their telegram channel or by registering their metamask wallet address.

One of the crazy airdrops from way back came from the Ontology team in 2018. They were supposed to have an ICO but it got canceled as they achieved their target investment through their pre-selling period. As a reward for those who registered for their canceled ICO, the Ontology team airdropped 1000 ONT to each registered user. If you immediately sold your ONT coins back then, you will easily get 1 Bitcoin.

Unfortunately, airdrops are not that common now but there are still some coins that sometimes provide airdrops to users simply by holding specific coins. Other coins provide monthly airdrops for coin holders. You can check different sites like [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/airdrop/), [coinmarketcal](https://coinmarketcal.com/en/) or [coindar](https://coindar.org/) for details and instructions for future or ongoing airdrops.

**PROS:** Most of the time it is free money which you can use to buy more coins you want to accumulate. However, there are times when you need to hold specific coins to get the airdrops.
**CONS:** Airdropped coins may not always have significant value. Not as common as it used to be.

### 6. New Coins from Hardforks

{% image "bitcoincash.jpg" "bitcoincash" %}

If you've been in cryptocurrency for a while then you're most probably familiar or at least heard about forks. In cryptocurrency, a fork happens when there are changes made to a coin's protocol. Forking in cryptocurrency generally falls into two categories: Soft Fork and Hard Fork. A Soft fork happens when there are protocol upgrades or changes that are backward compatible with validating nodes. A hard fork, on the other hand, is a major protocol change that is not backward compatible with validating nodes and requires updated clients. Most of the time, hard forks just update the overall functionality of the coin. However, there are instances where hard forks occur and miners/users of the coins are divided which results in the creation of an entirely new coin.

The two most popular forks are Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic. Bitcoin Cash was a result of a hard fork due to the disagreement in the Bitcoin community on how to properly scale Bitcoin. One group wanted to stick with a 1MB block size while another group wanted to increase the blocksize. A consensus wasn't reached which eventually led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash. 

Ethereum Classic on the other hand was created due to the exploit found in the DAO which resulted in millions of dollars being lost. One group wanted to fix the issue by reversing the DAO hack and returning all the stolen Ethereum while another group wanted to retain the integrity of the blockchain. Similar to what happened to Bitcoin Cash, a consensus wasn't reached which resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic.

In both scenarios above, the hard fork caused the creation of new coins. Most of the time hard forks create a ratio of 1:1 tokens. This means your Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic coins quantity will be based on the amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum you were holding at that period. So if you were holding 10 Bitcoins during the fork, you will get 10 Bitcoin Cash after the fork.

New coins from Hard Forks can sometimes be worthless but in the case of Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic, they had a strong community behind them which still made them valuable even after the fork. In some scenarios, selling new coins created from the fork and buying other coins is a good way to increase your holdings. When Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, and Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision were created I immediately sold them and bought other coins.

As with airdrops, hard forks can be monitored through coinmarketcal and coindar.

**PROS:** Free cash if you're holding the coin which gets forked. Most of the time you don't have to do anything to get the free coins if they are in an exchange.
**CONS:** Similar to airdrops, not all coins you get from forks may be valuable. If you don't own any of the coins that will be forked, you need to buy them first.
