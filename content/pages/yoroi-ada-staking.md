There are multiple ways to earn in crypto. You can mine, trade, stake, provide liquidity or just "HODL" your coins. In this post I'll go in detail on how to stake your ADA so that you can earn more ADA everyday!

*Crypytocurrencies are very volatile assets! Only invest what you can afford to lose!*

I've been a Cardano fan ever since I heard about it a few years back from a friend (thanks Cube!) I believe that it has the potential to match or even exceed Ethereum and build its own ecosystem in the future. I'll write about why I invested in Cardano in a future post but for now let's see what we need to do in order to stake Cardano.

There are multiple ways to stake Cardano. Some exchanges like Binance for example offers a service which allows you to stake Cardano. On the other hand, there are wallets like Exodus, Yoroi and Daedalus which allows you to do it as well. This post will focus on staking Cardano using Yoroi.

**Note:** The succeeding steps discussed here assumes that you have some ADA available which you can then send your Yoroi wallet. If you don't have any ADA yet, I suggest you go sign up in [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=11362368) and buy some USDT using the P2P feature, and buy ADA using that USDT.

### How to Stake Cardano in Yoroi

1. Before we start, make sure you have downloaded and installed Yoroi in your mobile phone.
2. After installation, open the app, choose the language to be used and accept the terms and agreement provided.
3. You will then be asked for a PIN. Enter your desired PIN to proceed. *(Note: You will always be prompted for this PIN whenever you open up your Yoroi wallet. Don't forget your PIN!)*
4. In the next screen you will be asked to choose between creating a shelley-era or a byron-era wallet. Choose shelley-era. 
5. In the next screen you have multiple options, you can create a new wallet, restore a wallet and connect to a ledger device. Choose *CREATE A WALLET* in this step.
6. Enter a name for your wallet and a spending password to continue. *(Note: This spending password will be used for your succeeding transactions in this wallet. Make sure to take note of it.)* 
7. In the next screen you will be shown 15 random words. **This will be your recovery phrase. Write it down and keep it somewhere safe. The order and spelling of these words are very important! Make sure that you write down the details correctly. If your phone breaks down or gets stolen, you can use this recovery phrase to restore your wallet in either Yoroi or Daedalus.**
8. Tap on *YES, I HAVE WRITTEN IT DOWN*.
9. A prompt is shown informing you that the keys are only stored in your device and that your funds can be recovered in another wallet using these keys. Tap on *I UNDERSTAND* to proceed to the next screen.
10. You will now be asked to tap each word in the correct order based on your recovery phase. Look at what you've written down and tap the words in order. If you think everything is correct, tap on *CONFIRM*. If everything is ok, you should now see your wallet with 0.000000 ADA in available funds. Next step is to send funds to this wallet.
11. To send ADA to your wallet, you first need to get this wallet's address. To do this, tap on the *Receive* icon on the bottom of the application. You can then share the QR Code or copy the address by pressing the information button (small letter i) and tapping on the *COPY ADDRESS* button.
12. Assuming you have signed up on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=11362368) and bought some ADA, you send your ADA to your Yoroi wallet by following these steps:
13. Go your Spot wallet in Binance
14. Look for Cardano and choose *Withdrawal*. 
15. In the address field, paste the address you copied earlier. Make sure that the network chosen is *Cardano*.
16. Enter the amount of ADA you wish to transfer then tap on *Withdrawal*. 
17. Once your request for withdrawal has been processed by Binance you should receive your ADA in your Yoroi wallet in a few seconds.
18. Once you receive your ADA in your Yoroi wallet, tap on the *Delegate* icon at the bottom.
19. In the succeeding screen you will be shown a list of staking pools currently available. You can see the respective ROA or interested rate for each staking pool. Ideally it's best to choose a pool which is not fully saturated yet to help the network be more decentralized but it's up to you on which pool to choose. After choosing your desired staking pool, tap on *DELEGATE*.
20. In the next screen you need to enter the amount of ADA you want to to stake and as well as your spending password. This screen will also show the approximate ADA you will get per epoch (more on this later) as a reward. An initial fee of ~2.14 ADA (as of this writing) and a small transaction fee will be deducted from your funds if you choose to proceed. If everything looks fine to you, tap on *DELEGATE*

And that's it! Congratulations you have successfully staked your ADA using your Yoroi wallet. You will now be earning more ADA after each epoch.

### Some Notes

+ After staking your ADA you can go to the Dashboard in your Yoroi wallet to see the available funds and rewards you have earned so far.
+ If this is the first time you staked with your wallet you need to wait for at least 4 epochs or 20 days before you see the rewards in your dashboard.
+ Your rewards will not be the same per epoch, some epochs might earn you more or less ADA than the previous epoch, in the long term it will even out to about the same as the interest you saw when you delegated.
+ You can still add more ADA or withdraw ADA from your wallet even while you're staking. Your funds are never locked.
+ Compared to other staking approaches, staking in Yoroi is **100% safe** as your funds never leave your wallet.
