Most of the people who I had a chance to speak to regarding Bitcoin but haven't jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon yet often complain about two things. First is "Bitcoin is too expensive and I won't be able to buy one." The second is, "This is all too technical for me and I'm afraid I might lose money if I do something wrong."

We'll tackle the first point in this post and touch a bit about the 2nd point.

"Bitcoin is too expensive and I won't be able to buy one." is one of the most common misconception about Bitcoin. While it is true that Bitcoin is expensive (currently trading at ~50,000 USD as of writing), it doesn't necessarily mean you won't be able to buy Bitcoin since you can buy a fraction of it. Yup, you've read that right. You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin for 50,000 USD. You can buy 100 USD or even 50 USD worth of Bitcoin. So how do you buy one?

There are multiple ways of buying Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. You can buy from different websites, exchanges or from other people. Let's look at the different ways you can buy Bitcoin. Note that most of my examples will be focused on folks residing in Singapore and the Philippines but most of it should be applicable to you not unless the site I mention is blocked in your country.

### Buying from Coinhako

If you're in Singapore, one of the most convenient place to buy Bitcoin is thru Coinhako. Simply [sign up](https://www.coinhako.com/affiliations/sign_up/LEMUELLOUI_802098) (PS. This is using my referral link), and submit your KYC (know your customer) documents for verification. This is required for majority of the sites selling cryptocurrencies. After your KYC is completed and your profile has been verified you can simply click on *Buy with Card*:

Enter the details of your purchase:

Click *Buy BTC* and you're done.

You can also download the coinhako application on your mobile phone and follow the steps mentioned above.

### Buying from Coinbase

Outside Singapore, the easiest way in my opinion to buy Bitcoin is thru Coinbase. You just need to sign up first [here](https://www.coinbase.com/join/villan_9b) (PS. This is using my referral link). After signing up, you will have to undergo a KYC (know-your-customer) verification. After your KYC is completed and your profile has been verified you can simply click on the Buy/Sell button in Coinbase:

Add a payment method and enter the details of your chosen payment method (since this is your first time buying):

{% image "coinbase-addpayment.png" "coinbase buy/sell" "300px" %}

Enter the amount you wish to buy and click *Buy Bitcoin*:

You can also download the Coinbase application on your mobile phone and follow the same steps mentioned above.

### Buying from Coins.ph

If you're in the Philippines, the most convenient way (but not necessarily the best) to buy Bitcoin is thru Coins.ph. Simply [sign up](https://app.coins.ph/welcome/signup), and submit your KYC documents for verification. After your KYC is completed and your profile has been verified you can click on the *Cash In* link, select from the multitude of payment channels available (there's a ton of payment channels and I won't be able to go into detail one by one), enter the amount you wish to buy and you're done.

You can also download the Coins.ph application on your mobile phone and follow the same steps mentioned above.

*Please note that there are other ways to buy Bitcoin. The things I mentioned above are the most convenient way for beginners to buy Bitcoin but it's not necessarily the cheapest. There are other cheaper ways you can buy Bitcoin which I will cover in succeeding posts.*

### I got my coins now, what's next?

Whichever method you chose to buy your first Bitcoin, the end result will alway be your bitcoin being sent to your Bitcoin wallet in your chosen site. So what's next? If you've been following this post, and I assume you have, I need to warn you that the Bitcoin you just bought is not yet technically yours. They are currently in a custodial wallet from whichever site you bought them from. Custodial wallets means that the private keys of the wallet does not belong to you. And there's a famous saying in cryptocurrency:

> *Not your keys, not your coins*

This means that if the site where you got your Bitcoin got hacked, there's a high probability that you will lose your coins. So what options do you have?

+ Add a 2-Factor Authentication to all sites where you bought your bitcoins using Google Authenticator/Authy/LastPass Authenticator
+ Install non-custodial wallets in either your mobile or desktop/laptop and transfer your coins there
+ If you prefer to just buy once and keep it for a long time you can either create a paper wallet or purchase a hardware wallet and send your coins for safe keeping.

I'll be writing about those three bullets I mentioned above later on. Keep in mind that you can still keep your coins in these sites but it's much safer and better to keep them secure on your non-custodial wallets.
