If you haven't been living under a rock you've probably heard of cryptocurrencies at some point. From a man [buying pizza with 10,000 bitcoins](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/a-%24200-million-pizza-heres-how-bitcoin-made-that-possible-...-2020-12-02), to Elon Musk's Doge [hype tweets](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1364560733472579591), to a man buying [art for millions of dollars](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/11/most-expensive-nft-ever-sold-auctions-for-over-60-million.html), the word about cryptocurrencies has been spread far and wide. But what are crytocurrencies?

Before we define what cryptocurrencies are, let's take a step back and see where the currencies we are using today originated.

In the olden days, money as we know it didn't exist yet. Early exchanges between people were done through bartering. Bartering is the exchange of goods or services between two parties without the use of money. The medium of exchange used in bartering often involved cattles or other livestocks and even [cowrie shells](https://www.culturesofwestafrica.com/cowrie-shell-monetary-symbolic-value/)! 

Later on, bringing tons of shells just to purchase a goat didn't make much sense. The medium of exchange changed from animal skins to weapons and tools and then metal coins. The earliest record in history for metal coins came from China, however a region in Europe called Lydia (now known as Turkey) became the very first region which industrialized making metal coins.

Eventually metal coins became paper money. This transition made sense as paper money was easier to store and transport as it occupies less space compared to their metal coin equivalent. The gold standard was later on used by different governments where in a paper money has an equivalent fixed amount of gold. After the gold standard was totally abolished, different countries started printing their own currency most of which we still use today.

So what are cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies by definition are digital or virtual currencies that is secured by cryptography. Most cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum) are based on the blockchain technology (distributed ledger systems) while there are others (IOTA, Nano) which are based on Directed Acrylic Graph (DAG).

Originally, the main idea for cryptocurrency, specially Bitcoin, was to be a trustless peer-to-peer electronic cash system (though I can argue that Bitcoin isn't like that anymore, but I'll talk about it in a different post next time). Later on, other cryptocurrencies branched out and focused on different functionalities. One prominent cryptocurrency is Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is a decentralized software platform which allows the usage of Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (DApps). This allowed other developers to create their own token with different specifications running on top  of Ethereum's blockchain. This breakthrough eventually helped push different innovations in the cryptocurrency space.

As the cryptocurrency space grew and matured, a lot more cryptocurrencies were created for much more specific purposes. There are coins for decentralized storage (Siacoin, Filecoin, Storj, Maidsafe), decentralized finance (PancakeSwap, UniSwap, Aave), Internet of Things (IOTA, VeChain), gaming (Enjin, Decentraland, Dawn Protocol), NFTs (Chiliz, ECOMI) and even memes (Doge).

Cryptocurrencies will soon be part of our lives similar to other technologies that we regularly use today. I'll be trying my best to help you learn more about crypto from [buying your first (fraction of a) bitcoin](/first-bitcoin), trading cryptocurrencies, staking them to earn more coins and safely storing them for the long term.
