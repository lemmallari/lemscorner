Ever since I got involved with cryptocurrencies until today, I noticed that a lot of people are still not familiar with crypto wallets and how important it is to be using a non-custodial wallet. In this post I'll explain what a wallet is, the difference between a custodial and a non-custodial wallet (and why you should be using a non-custodial one) and some important things to take note of when sending or receiving funds in your wallet.

### What is a Crypto Wallet

A crypto wallet doesn't work like a tradition wallet where you keep your bills or coins. Contrary to what most people think, your cryptocurrencies are not inside your crypto wallet, rather, they are stored in their respective networks. A Crypto Wallet is just tool which gives you the capability of interacting (send, receive, sign, etc) with your coins'; network. So how does a crypto wallet work?

To keep things simple, you can compare how crypto wallets work similar to how you send and receive an e-mail. When setting up an e-mail account, you provide an e-mail address you wish to use and provide the password which will authorize you to view the e-mails you received. In a cryptocurrencies, whenever you create a wallet a private key (password) and public key (e-mail address) gets generated.

When sending an e-mail to someone, you need to know their e-mail address. Similarly, when sending out coins in crypto, you will need a wallet address which will be receiving your coins. Your private key for your crypto wallet acts like your e-mail password. It should always only be known to you at all times. Never share your private keys/seed phrase with anyone. Ever.

Your private keys, similar to your e-mail password, tells the network that the coins related to the public key (wallet address) belongs to you. If someone gets hold of your private key, they can use it to send your coins to their own wallets. Similar to when someone gets hold of your e-mail password, they can send out e-mails on your behalf.

### Custodial and Non-Custodial Wallets

There are multiple kinds of crypto wallets, however the most important thing to know and understand is the difference between a custodial and a non-custodial wallet.

Custodial wallets are wallets in which you don't own your private keys. Some software wallets and the wallets you use in exchanges are non custodial wallets. All you have is your wallet address and that's it. As mentioned above private keys are important as it tells the network that the coins are really yours. With custodial wallet's you're trusting a 3rd party that they won't run away with your coins.

Custodial wallets are very easy to use compared to non-custodial wallets as their main functionalities revolve around sending and receiving coins. However, you need to understand that since you don't own or have control of the private keys for this types of wallets, the coins are not yours. Like I keep telling my friends involved crypto:

> Not your keys, not your coins.

Non-custodial wallets on the other hand are wallets where you have total control of both private and public keys. It's your responsibility to make sure that you have your private key/seed phrase written down and kept in a safe place. Other than sending and receiving coins, non-custodial wallets also allow users to digitally sign their transactions or trigger and approve smart contract functions.

Now that you have an idea of the difference between the two, what wallet should you use? My suggestion is if you are not planning on trading the coins that you own, it is better to store them in non-custodial wallets. Some wallets like Cardano's Yoroi and Daedalus wallets allow you to stake your coins which will earn interest (I'll create a post about this soon). However you're trading on major platforms like Binance and Coinbase Pro, you really have no choice but to use their custodial wallet (and just pray hard enough that they don't run away with your coins).

### Other Important Notes on Wallets

There are multiple wallets in crypto and each wallet has its own implementation and features that help users to interact with their coins network. Below are some things you need to take note of when using your wallets, specially when sending out funds from one wallet to another:

+ Always double check the address when sending out or withdrawing crypto to make sure that it's the correct address.
+ If possible, scan the QR code of the wallet you're sending to instead of copy-pasting it.
+ For some coins or wallets, they need additional information other than the wallet address. These additional information are usually shown in the receiving and sending screens of your wallet.
+ Some exchanges do not accept coins sent out to the same addresses for some coins. Make sure to read other notices of exchange wallets prior to sending or withdrawing coins.
+ Some wallets automatically generate an additional wallet address or an alias which just points to the same address in your coin's network.
+ Some coins can be sent to different networks (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Tron, etc). Some wallets do not provide any error checking if the address you entered is valid for the network you're sending to.
+ When sending or receiving coins, there is always a transaction id paired to it. To monitor the progress of these transactions, you can go to your coin's explorer and paste the transaction id there to see how many confirmations the transaction has.
+ If you have significant crypto holdings and not actively trading, get a hardware wallet from Ledger or Trezor.
+ Never. Ever. Share. Your. Private. Keys.
